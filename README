A simple, moderately extensible, hopefully well-organized 2/2.5D game engine.  Uses tools developed for the COSPC-Raycaster project, and the same world and texture formats, but much improved wit support for pluggable renderers.  This allows for exactly the same game to be played in either semi-3D (with raycasting) or in 2D (with top-down rendering), with the same logic and physics systems.
